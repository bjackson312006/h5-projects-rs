//! Contains the `Broadcast` type, which is basically just a wrapper around `embassy_sync::pubsub::PubSubChannel` but specifically meant for allowing tasks to subscribe to an awaitable trigger signal.
//! 
//! u_TODO - if actually keep using this then this should probably be a standalone crate (maybe in firmware-rs repo) so it can be reused
